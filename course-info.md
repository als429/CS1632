This course is designed to give the student a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Topics covered will include: manual and automated testing, test driven and behavior driven development, performance testing, security testing, and testing strategy. Entire courses could be dedicated to any one of these topics. My goal is to introduce each topic and provide practical skills that are used in the industry.

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group projects, and students to do entirely their own work on the other projects. Projects may be analyzed with the Stanford *moss* system to detect unauthorized collaboration between groups or individuals. Any student caught collaborating or cheating will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub to *a private repository* and shared with me by the beginning of class on the due date. Write-ups are due at the beginning of class and must be given to me in person. Write-ups must be PRINTED OUT and handed in.

Late assignments may be turned in one class late, but you will receive a -20 percentage point penalty (e.g., if you would have received a 90 on an assignment, but you turned it in late, you would receive 90 - 20 = 70%.)

Please ensure that you have a student GitHub account so that you can make private repositories. This is free and available here: <https://education.github.com/>

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground truth". For example, if Partner A insists that they did all the work, but GitHub history shows only commits by Partner B, I will assume that Partner B has done all the work.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.

# Attendance

Although you are not required to come to every class, it is recommended that you do. You *are* required to be present for exams. Exams will NOT be allowed to be made up except with a valid and verified excuse (generally medical - others are left to the discretion of the instructor).

Many days include an in-class exercise. Although attendance will not be taken, nor will the exercises be graded, it is *strongly* recommended that you show up for these as they will allow you to verify that you know the basics of the tools being taught, can have them installed, etc. If you are having trouble with the deliverable, the instructor will always ask to see the results of the relevant exercise *before* helping with the deliverable. In other words, finishing the exercise is necessary proof that you have done the bare minimum in understanding the project before asking for additional help.

## Programming Language Selection

The class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks and tools (e.g., JUnit, Mockito, Selenium, VisualVM, Findbugs).

# Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to, tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in 216 William Pitt Union or see [www.drs.pitt.edu](http://www.drs.pitt.edu/) for more computer technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements, DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing information."

The instructor will work to the best of their ability to accommodate any issues arising from a disability that a student has, but he must be aware of it in order to accommodate it. Please inform me as soon as possible if you have a disability which you think may hinder your success in the course and we (along with the DRS) should be able to work around it.



# Academic Integrity Statement

The integrity of the academic process requires fair and impartial evaluation on the part of faculty and honest academic conduct on the part of students. To this end, students are expected to conduct themselves at a high level of responsibility in the fulfillment of the course of their study. It is the corresponding responsibility of faculty to make clear to students those standards by which students will be evaluated and the resources permissible for use by students during the course of their study and evaluation. The educational process is perceived as a joint faculty-student enterprise which will perforce involve professional judgment by faculty and may involve—without penalty—reasoned exception by students to the data or views offered by faculty.

Cheating/plagiarism will *not* be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed.
