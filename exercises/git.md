# Git Exercise

This class will use git for all deliverable submissions. This exercise is meant to help you get familiar with git and github.

The first step is to create a github account and if you haven't already, register as a student, <https://education.github.com/>. Student's get github pro features for free.

Once you've created an account, create a new repository and name it ConnectFour and make it private. After the repo is created, click the 'Import Code' button at the bottom of the screen and import this repository, https://github.com/asphaltpanthers/ConnectFour.git.

You're now ready to clone this github repo onto your local machine. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder you would like to store your code in. Execute the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/ConnectFour.git
```

Next, you can begin development. Here are some common git commands you will use often.

```
//Commit code to your local repository.
git commit -a -m "Small change to readme.md"

//Push code the the remote repository.
git push

//Pull code from the remote repository.
git pull
```

I recommend using a git UI. Sourcetree is a good one, <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>.
